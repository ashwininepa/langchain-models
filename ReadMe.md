**Get API Keys**
1. OPENAI: You can get your API Key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) site. It costs $5 to get a basic billing account and I used it and one can use make a great use of it. I made a few requests using my personal account.
1. Anthropic: You can get your API key from [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/dashboard) site. Same as OPENAI, $5 for credit buying. I didn't buy this one. But the code shows the demonstration.
